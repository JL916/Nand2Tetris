     Download the Nand2Tetris Software Suite
    </a>
    to your computer. The software suite includes all the software tools and project files that will be used throughout the course. After downloading, locate file.txt in the nand2tetris/projects/00 folder on your computer. There is no need to understand or modify the contents of this file, the only purpose of this assignment is to verify that you know how to submit files using our course platform. To prepare you for the next projects, you will need to compress the file into a zip file named project0.zip, and submit this zip file. You can find
    <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Zip-File">
     instructions on making zip files here
    </a>
    . Make sure that the zip file only contains file.txt, and that file.txt is in the top level of the zip file and
    <strong>
     not located inside a folder
    </strong>
    . (The instructor's comment in unit 0.4 to "upload the file as is" meant that you are not supposed to modify the file's contents. So, you are to upload the file as is, yet within a zip file, as instructed here).

    If you are taking the course as an auditor, just check that you can locate file.txt in the nand2tetris/projects/00 folder. If you are taking the certificate option, submit project0.zip, containing the file nand2tetris/projects/00/file.txt
