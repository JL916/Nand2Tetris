   Project 1: Elementary Logic Gates
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Before starting to work on Project 1, make sure you read Appendix A of the book, and the HDL Survival Guide
  </strong>
  . There is no need to read these documents back to back. Rather, use them as technical references, on a need-to-know basis. That is, if you have an HDL problem, consult these references first before posting a question in the forum.
 </p>
 <p>
  The outcome of your work will be a set of text files, containing the HDL code of the 15 chips that you are expected to build. If you succeed building all 15 chips, great. If you manage to build only some of the chips, you can still submit them for partial credit.
 </p>
 <p>
  To ensure proper testing and feedback, the names of the HDL files that you submit must be the exact file names that appear in the nand2tetris/projects/01 folder on your computer.
  <em>
   Note that case matters
  </em>
  : a file named and.hdl or AND.hdl may fail our testing and grading procedures (the correct name must be And.hdl). You can save yourself all this hustle by neither creating nor naming any files: simply edit the *.hdl files in your nand2tetris/projects/01 folder using any text editor, write your HDL code in them, and save them using their given names.
 </p>
 <p>
  You should pack all the *.hdl files that you wrote as one zip file named project1.zip (pack the files themselves, don't put them inside any folders), and submit it. If you build helper chips that were not specified by the course, you should include them in the zip file. You have an unlimited number of submissions, and the grade will be the maximum of all your submissions, so you can't lose points by submitting again.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you are taking the course as an auditor, you can check your work yourself, using the tests described
  <a href="http://nand2tetris.org/01.php">
   here
  </a>
  . If you are taking the certificate option, submit your project zip file here.
